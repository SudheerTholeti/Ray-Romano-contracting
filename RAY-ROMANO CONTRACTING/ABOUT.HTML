                <h3>JAMIE FLOYD: UPPER WEST SIDE CLASSIC 6</h3><br>
                <p>"Ray Romano rocks. Listen to this: He did a complete GUT on an eight-room wreck in less than 8 weeks.
                    I do not recommend it for anyone. It is CRAZY. But we have little kids and we had no choice. Ray
                    Romano and his team got it done! The place is beautiful!"</p><br>
                <h3>DONNA AND SCOTT: RESCUED RENOVATION</h3><br>
                <p>"Ray rescued us from a contractor job gone bad. He and his crew are great, neat and real artisans. We
                    recommend him very highly and I bet before we know it, there will be another "Everybody loves
                    Raymond," but on HGTV or TLC!"</p><br>
                <h3>DAVID SIEGEL: DOUBLED THE VALUE</h3>
                <p>"Ray added value in ways that other G.C.s can't. Working with him is a pleasure. He more than doubled
                    the value of my apartment through his gut renovations. I would recommend him to any person looking
                    to make home improvements."</p>
